# Python is a General Purpose Programming Language
# Has a Large standard Library

print('Hello, Python!') 

import sys 
print(sys.version)

# type() shows us the data type of the input

print(type(12))

# Type Casting
print(float(10))
print(int(10.5))

# Type casting the int inside the string gives out the int inside the string unlike c++ in which we had to subtract '0' to get the actual int inside the string
print(int('10'))

# The code below gives an error 
# print(int('A'))


# int and float can be converted into Strings

print(str(20.5))

# In boolean Values it Is necessary to use Uppercase T and F in True and False
# int Value of 1 is True and of 0 is False and vice-versa

# this ->  // is used for Int division ,It rounds up the result
